h2. Overview

This extension enables you to open "TortoiseSVN":http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ directly.
When you click the link to one of the registered URLs, TortoiseSVN Repository Browser is opened automatically.

This extension also provide some context menus to open TortoiseSVN Repository Browser, Log Viewer and Blame Viewer.

This extension is a Google Chrome™ version of "Open TortoiseSVN for Firefox":https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/open-tortoisesvn/.

h2. For Developers

Because of restriction of Google Chrome™, we have to use NPAPI plugin to run local programs.
Therefore, I developed NPAPI plugin which runs TortoiseSVN.

"Gecko SDK":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_SDK "ver. 1.9.2":http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/3.6.23/sdk/xulrunner-3.6.23.en-US.win32.sdk.zip is needed to compile this NPAPI plugin.
